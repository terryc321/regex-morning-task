# Regex Morning Task

This morning is your chance to get to grips with Regex. We won't be going on a deep dive into Regex, we are really just going to scratch the surface.

Regex is a very powerful tool and this task is mostly here to build awareness.

First things first, take some time before you start the task to read through our notes on Regex.

[read the notes plz](https://notes.northcoders.com/courses/js-intro-week/regex)

Now you're ready to start the task, fork and clone this repository and have a look at `regex.js` - this should give you instruction of how to get going.

If you want to run the file you can do so by checking your location in the terminal with `pwd` and using node - `node regex.js`.

Remember to keep up those git practices of adding, committing and pushing your changes.
